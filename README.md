### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**gisellecole/gisellecole** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:-->

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on expanding my skills as a developer and taking on various front-end projects. I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually appealing and user-friendly websites.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React to enhance my knowledge of building dynamic and interactive web applications. I'm excited to explore the possibilities that React offers.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects or join a team where I can contribute my skills and learn from other talented developers. Collaborating with like-minded individuals is always a great opportunity for growth and knowledge sharing.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me playing tennis, assembling Legos, or in the kitchen cooking delicious meals for my husband. I enjoy staying active, being creative, and exploring my culinary skills.

Looking forward to connecting with you and learning together!
